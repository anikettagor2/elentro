## 🗳️ Project Overview

**Electron** is a comprehensive, AI-powered election simulation platform designed to educate users on the **Indian Electoral Process** and model complex political scenarios. Built for the **Virtual Prompt War 2026**, Electron bridges the gap between raw data and immersive storytelling.

The platform features a dual-core experience:
1.  **Immersive Voter Journey**: A 10-stage interactive walkthrough of the election lifecycle, from electoral roll preparation to the final declaration of results.
2.  **Predictive Simulation Engine**: Powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**, allowing strategists to model cause-and-effect outcomes based on budget, strategy, and demographics.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. The 10-Stage Election Journey
An immersive educational module detailing the Election Commission of India (ECI) workflow:
- **Interactive Voter Registration**: A simulator for verifying voter identity and biometrics.
- **Nomination & Scrutiny**: Visual guide to the candidate vetting process.
- **The Campaign**: Modeling the impact of digital vs. ground mobilization.
- **Interactive EVM Simulator**: A high-fidelity module with a functional VVPAT slip generator.

### 2. AI-Driven Simulation (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
- **Multi-Dimensional Modeling**: Analyze how decisions impact Urban, Rural, Youth, and Diaspora segments.
- **Dynamic Budgeting**: Real-time visualization of resource allocation impact.
- **Strategic Intelligence Reports**: Automated, deep-dive insights generated after each simulation using Gemini 1.5 Pro.

### 3. AI Assistant (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- **Flash-Chat**: A low-latency chatbot powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash to answer questions about election laws, stages, and voter registration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1 (App Router), React 19
- **AI Models**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (Strategy), Gemini 1.5 Flash (Chat)
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Run (Serverless Hosting), Cloud Build (CI/CD Automation)
- **Data & Ops**: BigQuery (Voter Analytics), Cloud Logging (Observability), Artifact Registry (Container Security)
